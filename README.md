# Connect4
Wanna play the Connect 4 game with a friend? Run this node server, host for online game. Server is hosted on port 3000 by default currently. On a local lan you can host it in a group by \<ip address\>:3000/hg-\<any text no space\>

# Want to Contribute?
Points for style and **readability**
Please no security or blocks in usability **until misuse requires them**
 * When security changes are required, please log the first time it was misused and why the change is required. Examples below.



# Examples of security that will probably be implemented in the future and possible reasons.
## A website copied/cloned the project not from code but from hosted. 
   1. Provide a link and the date the issue occurred.
   2. Why is this a problem (description) (In this case especially important, since the project is open source anyway, perhaps a license violation)
   3. What is the solution?
   4. How will changes prevent the issue from occurring again?

## Copyright images/indecent images were uploaded. 
  1. Provide a date of misuse.
  2. Why is this a problem: Illegal, not family friendly etc.
  3. Creating user accounts to allow/block users
  4. Anonymity is used by many to hide from evil acts, people won't be so eager to do bad things if they can be held accountable, or can block users that upload illicit material ect.

The idea behind this is so that security grows naturally and a sort of psychological experiment to see what security is the first needed in the modern internet. Because of this requirement. Any form of logging and tracing to catch such behaviour will be greatly appreciated (even before such cases) if it is something that requires such logging to be identified. Below is a detailed list of any and all such monitoring while you are using/running this software as well as from which version they were implemented:
## Current Build:
**NOTHING**
## V1 ##
**NOTHING**

#Note:
Will update this readme to read better and be more informative/specific once the base game works fully or it is required.
